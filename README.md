## Introduction
### Project Purpose 
The Library Management System was developed to modernise library operations by addressing inefficiencies such as reliance on physical library cards and the lack of a recommendation system. Built with the MERN stack and TypeScript, the goal was to create a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform that improves both librarian workflows and user experience

### Features 
Key features include QR code-based book loans, automated return tracking, a TF-IDF-powered recommendation engine for book discovery, and seamless third-party API integration (Google Books). The system also incorporates role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure secure authentication and permission management. Together, these features highlight the ability to combine modern web technologies with practical library needs, delivering both secure access and an intuitive user experience

### Technical Learns 
This project allowed me to develop skills in designing and implementing scalable single-page applications, managing global state with React’s Context API and useState, and building modular RESTful APIs with Express.js, while also gaining practical experience with React Router for SPA navigation. I also developed awareness of testing and performance optimization practices essential for scalable frontend development

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** React, Material-UI for styling(Leveraging CSS3 Standard), integrated react-router-dom for SPA(Single Page Application) navigation
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose (With Nodemon for development)
- **Image Data Handling:** Multer for file uploads
- **Data security:** JWT(JSON web token) for Authentication, Bcrypt for password hashing
- **Environment Configuration:** dotenv for managing environment variables
- **Algorithms:** TF‑IDF for recommendation engine (Implemented with the natural library in Node.js)
- **Other**: RESTful APIs with modular design, Docker for containerization and environment consistency
  
## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure login system for librarians and users, leveraging JWT
- **Library Data Management:** CRUD functionality for users, books, contacts, and book metadata
- **QR Code Book Loans:** Scan QR codes to borrow books seamlessly
- **Loan & Return Tracking:** Log borrowing transactions, returns, and fine management
- **Book Recommendation System:** Uses TF-IDF and loan data analysis for personalized suggestions
- **Third-Party API Integration:** Fetch book details (ratings, ISBN, etc.) via the Google Books API
- **Auto Detect Data Duration:** Automatically identifies overdue borrowings with fine calculation and reinstates suspended users on their scheduled unsuspend date

## QR Code Handling (Frontend Only)
- The QR code is generated entirely on the frontend
- Encoded format: JSON object
  ```json
  {
    "username": "<string>",
    "userID": "<string>"
  }
- No backend API endpoint is required for QR code generation
- The QR code is used within the frontend modal for loan verification

## Automated Logic Overview
These automated backend functions run silently in the background and are difficult to showcase in a live demo. Instead, we present annotated source code images and accompanying logic descriptions to clearly explain their purpose and behavior<br>

***1. Detect Record Functions***<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Functions/DetectRecordDaily.png" style="width:40%;"/><br>
Performs scheduled scans for:
- Expired Loan Records
- Suspension Records
- Fine Calculations
This function acts as the entry point for daily automation checks (located in "backend/detectRecord.ts")

***2. Detect Expired Loan Book Records***<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Functions/DetectExpiredLoanRecord.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This source code (located in backend/schema/book/bookloaned.ts, Line 159–196) automatically performs detection and handling of expired loan records:
- Fetch: All loan records with "Loaned" status
- Compare: Each dueDate vs today
- Update Logic:
    - Set finesPaidStatus to "Not Paid"
    - Apply flat fineAmount of $1.5
- Message Logged: “Loan Record [ID] fines amount and paid status modified successfully!”

***3. Automatically Fines Calculation***<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Functions/FinesAmountCalculation.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This source code (located in backend/schema/book/bookloaned.ts, Line 198–232) automatically performs detection and handling of fines amount calculation:
- Days Overdue: Calculated from due date
- Fine Formula: $1.5 × days overdue, capped at $130
- Updates:
    - fineAmount set dynamically
    - finesPaidStatus set to "Not Paid"
- Message Logged: “Loan Record [ID] fines amount and paid status modified successfully!”


***4. Automatically Unsuspend User***<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Functions/SuspendRecordDetection.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This source code (located in backend/schema/user/suspendlist.ts, Line 99–137) automatically performs the process of unsuspending users whose suspension period has expired:
- Compare Dates: Compares each dueDate with today’s date
- User Status Update: "Suspended" → "Normal"
- Record Update:
    - Suspension status → "Unsuspend"
    - unSuspendDate → today
- Feedback Message: “Unsuspend user [ID] successfully!”


## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TomWai821/TS_MERN_LMS
    cd TS_MERN_LMS

2. **Set up environment variable:**
    Create a .env file in the root directory with Configuration variables
    ```
    frontend/.env:
    - REACT_APP_GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY  -> Google Books API key
    - REACT_APP_GOOGLE_BOOKS_BASE_URL -> Base URL for google books API (e.g. https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes)
    - REACT_APP_LOCAL_HOST            -> Backend API endpoint (e.g. http://localhost:5000/api) 
    - REACT_APP_MAIN_PAGE             -> Frontend main page URL (e.g. http://localhost:3000)
    ```
   
    ```
    backend/.env:
    - PORT       -> The backend port
    - MONGO_URI  -> MongoDB Connection String
        - Docker: `mongodb://mongo:27017`  
        - Local:  `mongodb://localhost:27017` 
    - JWT_SECRET -> Secret key for JWT authentication
    - ORIGIN_URI -> Frontend URL (e.g. http://localhost:${port})
    ```

    ```
    Remarks:
    - Express backend runs by default on port 5000
    - React frontend runs on port 3000
    - MongoDB stores default data in the `test` database
      If you encounter connection issues, try appending `/test` to your `MONGO_URI`
    ```

3. **Import data into MongoDB (Local only):**
    - Open MongoDB Compass and import the JSON file located in the MongoDBSchema folder
    - This JSON file contains the complete data schema required for the application
  
4. **Run the application:**
    ### Using Docker
    ```bash
    # Start the project
    docker compose up --build
    
    # Clean the persisted MongoDB data (optional)
    docker compose down -v
    ```

    Remarks:
    - The ./backend/MongoDBSchema folder is mounted to /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d in the MongoDB container
    - These initialisation scripts run only when the db-data volume is created for the first time
    - If the db-data volume already contains data, the scripts will be skipped
    - To re-run the initialisation and restore the demo data, remove the volume and restart
    - The backend requires this demo data to be present for proper functionality

    ### Using local environment
    ```bash
    # For the server side (in ./backend)
    nodemon backend/index.ts  
   
    # For the client side (in ./frontend)
    npm start
    ```

    Remarks: Running locally requires installing all dependencies beforehand:
    ```bash
    npm install   # in ./backend
    npm install   # in ./frontend
    ```

5. **Expected URLs:**
    - Backend API → http://localhost:5000/api
    - Frontend UI → http://localhost:3000

## Architecture
### Frontend
***Sequence Diagram (Authentication)***
    
1. Registration<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Diagrams/RegisterSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This sequence diagram illustrates the modular backend registration flow — from frontend validation and request dispatch, to database interaction and token generation. It ensures secure account creation with robust error handling and clean separation of concerns across services
       
2. Login<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Diagrams/LoginSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This sequence diagram illustrates the login flow across frontend and backend layers — from validation and request dispatch to database verification and token generation. It ensures secure authentication with proper error handling and modular separation across components such as middleware, endpoint logic, and MongoDB integration<br>
    
***Sequence Diagram (Project Features)***
1. External Data from Google Book API
<img src="doc/Image/Diagrams/SequenceDiagramForGetDataFromGoogleBook.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This sequence diagram illustrates the book data retrieval flow initiated by a frontend GET request to the Google Books API. When the user presses the book image, an event handler constructs and sends a request containing the book name and author name. Upon receiving the response, the event handler processes the returned data and renders the book results to the user interface<br>
    
2. QR Code Generation<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Diagrams/QRCodeModalSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This sequence diagram illustrates the QR Code generation flow initiated by a user interaction. When the user clicks the "Display QR Code" button, the event handler retrieves the authentication token and username from local or cookie storage. It then parses the data and sends a request to the QR Code Generator service. Upon receiving the response, the event handler opens a modal and displays the generated QR code to the user<br>
    
    
3. Book Recommendation<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Diagrams/BookRecommendSystemWithTF-IDF.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This sequence diagram illustrates the data retrieval flow for book recommendations, initiated by a frontend GET request containing a user's top ten loan records. The backend middleware verifies the user's authentication token, then parses and analyzes the loan data using TF-IDF. A request is sent to fetch book data based on the analysis, and the top recommended books are selected, structured, and returned to the client with proper status messaging<br>

    
***Sequence Diagram (CRUD operations)***
1. Get data from backend side<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Diagrams/GetDataSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This sequence diagram illustrates the data retrieval flow initiated via a frontend GET request. The process involves middleware-level parsing, backend token validation, and data querying from MongoDB. With modular orchestration across services and structured response handling, it ensures secure and reliable delivery of data to the client<br>
    
    
2. Data Creation<br>
<img src="doc/Image/Diagrams/CreateDataSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This sequence diagram illustrates the user confirmation flow, beginning with a frontend POST request and progressing through middleware parsing, backend validation, and MongoDB record creation. It demonstrates secure data handling with token verification, modular backend orchestration, and structured client response, ensuring reliability and clarity in the user confirmation process<br>
    
    
3. Data Modification
<img src="doc/Image/Diagrams/UpdateDataSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This sequence diagram illustrates the confirmation flow via a frontend PUT request, showing how user-modified data is securely validated, parsed, and updated in the backend. With middleware safeguards, token verification, and modular backend orchestration, the system ensures accurate record updates and clear client feedback
    
    
4. Data Deletion
<img src="doc/Image/Diagrams/DeleteDataSequenceDiagram.png" style="width:90%;"/><br>
This sequence diagram captures the user confirmation flow initiated via a frontend DELETE request. The process includes middleware-level data parsing, backend token validation, and MongoDB record deletion. Through structured response handling and modular orchestration across services, it ensures secure and reliable user operations<br>
    

### Backend

## Improvements

### Completed
1. **Introduced dotenv for environment variable management (backend side)**<br>
    - Sensitive configuration (API keys, DB URI, JWT secret) now stored securely in `.env` instead of hardcoding

2. **Redirected packages into separate frontend and backend directories**<br>
    - Independent `package.json` and `node_modules`, ensuring clean separation and avoiding mixed dependencies

3. **Modularised backend routes for cleaner structure**<br>
    - Reduced redundant code in authentication and data verification, improving maintainability

4. **Implemented server-side scheduled data updates (Node.js Interval)**<br>
    - Backend automatically refreshes or syncs data at defined intervals, reducing manual triggers (located in `./backend/src/detectRecord.ts`)

### Planned Improvements
1. **Apply custom hooks to centralise commonly used state**<br>
    - Reduce redundant state creation in view components (located in `./frontend/src/customhook.tsx`)

2. **Refactor Context API into two smaller custom hooks**<br>
    - One dedicated to managing data state, another for CRUD operations, improving maintainability and reducing complexity in view components

3. **Implement server-side pagination**<br>
    - Limit data returned in each GET request, improving frontend performance and user experience

4. **Upgrade server-side scheduled data updates**<br>
    - Replace prototype-level Node.js Interval with a production-grade scheduler (e.g. node-cron or cloud-based job scheduler) to ensure reliability, scalability, and better error handling
